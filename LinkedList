1. Have a reference for both head and last node
2. When creating the first node, both head and last node will point to the same node
3. When creating the further nodes, we will identify the last node and then insert the new node
4. The last nodes address will always be null
5. So how we can structure that -- lets code :)
6. Operations we can introduct
    Insert
    Iterate
